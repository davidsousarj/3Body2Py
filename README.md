# 3Body2Py
Three-Body Physics Problems built with Python and Pygame
#
It uses Python 2.7

There are three scripts so far:

1f2m.py : Simulator for 1 fixed and 2 mobile bodies.

2f1m.py : Simulator for 2 fixed and 1 mobile body.

matplotlib.py : This uses matplotlib's feature for animated plots. It is a bit more elegant version for the 2f1m problem.
